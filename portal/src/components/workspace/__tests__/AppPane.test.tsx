/**
 * THE APP PANE (Plan F, U4) — what it is called, how to get past it, and what it says instead.
 *
 * ═══ THE TRAP THIS FILE EXISTS FOR ═══
 *
 * U4 removes the four start affordances that lived inside `LivePreview`'s no-frame placeholders.
 * Those were, until this plan, the ONLY way to bring a stopped app back. An inertness-only
 * assertion — "the old strings are gone" — passes just as happily on a screen with no start control
 * at all, which would satisfy R3's "exactly one control starts it" with zero. So every no-frame
 * state that used to carry one is asserted here for the affordance's PRESENCE, not its absence.
